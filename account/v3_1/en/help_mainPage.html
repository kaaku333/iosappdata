        <dt>About Backup Files</dt>
        <dd>When you perform a backup, a single backup file is created. </dd>
        <dd>Backup files are saved in the Account folder created on your iPhone/iPad/Mac. You can copy or delete them from this app's folder using the Files app. You can also copy them back to this app's folder. </dd>
        <dd>Backup files with the .dat extension are encrypted with AES256 encryption using an encryption key associated with your Apple account. Therefore, they cannot be restored using any device other than this app on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac connected to your Apple account. </dd>
        <dd>If you want to transfer data to a device under a different Apple account, use a backup file with encryption turned off. </dd>
        <dd>When you back up with encryption turned off in the Backup Management screen, the data is compressed and has a .zip extension. The zip file can be opened on a PC. The data file in the zip file is a text file in JSON format, so it can be viewed in a text editor. However, the detailed format is subject to change without notice. To exchange data, use the <a href="#export">export and import functions</a>. </dd>
        
        <dd>Backups with comments beginning with "auto" are automatically created by the app just in case. You can delete them if you deem them unnecessary. </dd>

        <dd>If you place a backup file with encryption turned off in the iCloud folder, there is a risk that your password data may be leaked if your iCloud account is hacked.

        <dt>About iCloud Sync</dt>
        <dd>When a user logs in to multiple Apple devices, such as an iPhone, iPad, and Mac, with the same Apple account, they can sync user-entered data, such as item data, via iCloud Drive. </dd>
        <dd>The data synced is the same as backups, including item data, selection lists, display formats, filter data, and history information. </dd>
        <dd>Options set in the settings screen, etc., are not synced, so you can configure them to suit your device. </dd>
        <dd>If you turn on automatic sync in the iCloud Sync settings in the settings screen, syncing will occur automatically when you open the app, edit an item, or close it. </dd>
        <dd>If automatic syncing is inconvenient for you‚Äîfor example, if you frequently open this app on multiple devices at the same time, or if you don't want this app to use your mobile data‚Äîyou can leave automatic syncing OFF and manually upload and download data to and from iCloud in the settings screen. </dd>
        
        <dt>How iCloud Automatic Sync Works</dt>
        <dd>When you open this app, the app compares the update dates of the data on your device with the synced data on iCloud Drive and loads the newer data. </dd>
        <dd>When you close the app or edit an item, data is saved to both your device and iCloud Drive. </dd>
        <dd>Data update dates are compared and saved and loaded for all data at the same time. </dd>
        
        <dt>Notes before using iCloud automatic syncing</dt>
        <dd>If you want to share data between multiple devices, turn on iCloud sync before entering data on each device. Data entered on each device before syncing will not be merged; only the data from one device will be used for syncing. </dd>
        
        <dt>When Turning on iCloud Automatic Sync</dt>
        <dd>If you have entered data on multiple devices, follow the steps below.</dd>
        <dd>1. Upload data to iCloud from the device containing the data you want to sync.</dd>
        <dd>2. Download data from iCloud on devices other than those listed above.</dd>
        <dd>3. Turn on iCloud Automatic Sync on each device.</dd>
        <dd>This procedure is also effective if you suspect automatic syncing is not working properly.</dd>
        
        <dt>Data Update Time and Data Usage</dt>
        <dd>The last update time of data on your device (iPhone/iPad/Mac) and iCloud, the number of items, the device where it was saved, and the app version at the time are displayed, providing a rough indication of the sync status.</dd>
        <dd>The format version is also displayed; this is a number that updates when the app stores more information for syncing. </dd>
        <dd>Due to the nature of iCloud, it may take several minutes or even several tens of minutes for data to be updated between your device and iCloud. Also, if your internet connection is poor, all data will be updated at once once your connection is restored. </dd>
        
        <dt>Caution during iCloud automatic sync</dt>
        <dd>If you open this app simultaneously on your iPhone, iPad, and Mac and edit data on each device, please note that edits on one device may be ignored. </dd>
        <dd>If you frequently use this app, it is safer to explicitly upload to and download from iCloud in the settings screen rather than turning on automatic sync. </dd>
        <dd>When using iCloud automatic sync, there is a risk of unintentionally using the above methods, so it is a good idea to create backups from time to time just to be safe. </dd>
        <dd>By the way, this app automatically backs up your data when you start syncing and during the first daily autosave. Please use this as needed. </dd>
        
        <dt>Notes on Updating Apps</dt>
        <dd>Please try to update apps for iPhone, iPad, and Mac that share files via iCloud at the same time whenever possible. </dd>
        <dd>If you update data on only one device while the older version is still up to date, the older version device will be able to read data saved on the newer version, but will not be able to save data using the new features of the upgrade, which could result in data loss. </dd>
        <dd>If the file format of data is expanded due to new app features, the file format version will be upgraded. If data with a larger format version is stored in iCloud, disable iCloud automatic sync and upload until the app on that device is updated to prevent data loss. </dd>
        <dd>In this case, turn on iCloud automatic sync after updating the app. </dd>
