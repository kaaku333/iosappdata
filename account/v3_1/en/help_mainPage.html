         <dd>Synced data is shared only between devices logged in with the same Apple account through the user's own iCloud Drive folders that are not directly visible to the user. Furthermore, the item data itself is encrypted. </dd>
         <dd>In addition to automatic synchronization, you can also explicitly upload to and download from iCloud. </dd>
         <dt>About iCloud sync</dt>
         <dl class="sub0">
         <dt>Synchronization mechanism when iCloud auto-sync is ON</dt>
         <dd>When the application is launched, this application compares the update date and time of the data on the device (iPhone/iPad/Mac) and the data on iCloud, and loads the newer data. </dd>
         <dd>Save data to both the device and iCloud when the app is closed. </dd>
         <dd>Data update date comparison, saving and loading are performed collectively for all items.</dd>
         <dt>Precautions before iCloud synchronization</dt>
         <dd>Please note that if you enter data separately for multiple devices before iCloud sync, only the data for the last updated device will be valid. </dd>
         <dd>If you want to share data between multiple devices, please turn on iCloud sync before entering data on each device. </dd>
         <dt>When iCloud sync is turned on</dt>
         <dd>If you have entered data on multiple devices separately, follow the steps below. </dd>
         <dd>1. Upload to iCloud from the device that has the data you want to share with other devices. </dd>
         <dd>2. For devices other than the above, download from iCloud. </dd>
         <dd>3. Turn on iCloud sync on each device. </dd>
         <dd>This procedure is also useful during sync if you think something is not syncing. </dd>
         <dt>Data update date and time and data communication</dt>
         <dd>The last update date and time of the data on the device (iPhone/iPad/Mac) and iCloud is displayed, which can be used as a guideline for the synchronization status. </dd>
         <dd>Due to the mechanism of iCloud, it may take minutes to tens of minutes to reflect the data between the device and iCloud regardless of the update time. Also, when the network environment is bad, it will be reflected collectively when the network environment recovers. </dd>
         
         <dt>Notes during iCloud synchronization</dt>
         <dd>Please note that if you open this app on both iPhone and iPad and Mac at the same time and edit data on each device, the edits made on one device may be ignored. </dd>
         <dd>If you use as above frequently, it is safer to use upload to iCloud or download from iCloud instead of turning sync ON. </dd>
         <dd>It is a good idea to create backups from time to time, just in case, as you may unintentionally use the above when syncing with iCloud. </dd>
         
         <dt>Precautions when upgrading the app</dt>
         <dd>Please try to upgrade the iPhone and iPad and Mac apps that exchange files with iCloud as much as possible at the same time. </dd>
         <dd>If you update data while only one device is upgraded, the old version device can read the data saved by the new version device, but you cannot save the data using the new function due to the version upgrade. Therefore, you may lose data using the new features. </dd>
         <dd>If the data file format is expanded due to the addition of functions in the app, the file format version will be increased. If a bigger version of the data was stored on iCloud, iCloud sync and upload will stop until the app on that device is updated to prevent data loss. </dd>

         <dd>The backup file will not be deleted, so delete it on the backup management screen if necessary. </dd>
         <dd>You can also take a backup automatically when clearing the data. </dd>
        
         <dt>Full Function Version</dt>
         <dd>This app can create up to 50 items by default. If you want to add more items, please consider purchasing the full function version as an in-app purchase. </dd>
         <dd>Once you purchase the full function version, all features added in future updates are free. </dd>
        
         <dt>Debug Settings</dt>
         <dd>You can enable debug mode. This makes error messages for some functions, such as imports, more detailed, making it easier to determine the cause of errors.</dd>

         <dd>You can open the AppStore page of this app, write a review, or give feedback such as problems by email to the author. </dd>

         <dd>Since the backup file is encrypted with the encryption key associated with your Apple account, it cannot be restored except by this App on your iPhone or iPad or Mac that is used with your Apple account.</dd>
         <dd>If you want to copy data to the iPhone or iPad or Mac that is used with an Apple account other than your own, please use a backup file with encryption turned off. </dd>
         <dd>By sharing the backup file with other apps such as Notepad, you can store your data outside of the app. If you share a backup file from that app to this app, you can move it back to the backup folder. </a>
         <dd>Also, when you connect your iPhone/iPad to your PC, you can use iTunes (Windows) or Finder (Mac) to copy the backup file from the Account app folder to another folder and save it, or copy it back to the app folder.</dd>
         <dd>Please note that if you change the file name, it may no longer be visible on the backup management screen. </dd>
         <dd>Backup files with encryption OFF are compressed data with the extension .zip. The zip file can be opened on your PC. The data files in the zip file are text files in JSON format, so they can be viewed with a text editor. </dd>
         <dd>If you place a backup file with encryption turned off on the iCloud folder, there is a risk that your password data will be leaked if your iCloud is hacked.
